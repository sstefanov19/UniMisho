Todo React App

#1 First we initilized a project with vite, so we can use React. Also we have added a extra packages for tailwindcss , because the project is simple and with very few component so its better to use that approach instead of regular css

#2 We created a grid so we can devide the page in two different sections - Left and Right sections

Left section will help us store the uncompleted todos and some filtering option where we can see which person hasnt completed their task or just sort them by the name of the task


Right section will help us see the completed todos and if we forgot something we can uncheck them as well they are sorted with a date , also we can use the left side person option to check for the completed tasks as well


#3 How to run the project ->

1.clone the repository
2.npm run install
3.npm run dev
4.go to localhost:5173
